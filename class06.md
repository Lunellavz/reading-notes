# Notes on Javascript

## What is Javascript?

-A very flexible language
-Runs on input and gives an output
-Is a function on a page

**DO NOT MIX JAVASCRIPT AND JAVA**

Java is a different language than javascript.

## What are varibles?

-Variables are like boxes, and we store data in those organized boexes.
-There are 4 ways to declare a variable in Javascript:

1. var (OUTDATED)
2. let
3. const
4. nothing

## Example

var x=5
var y=4
var k=x+y

## But when should I use these different types of variable assigners?

Use var for Javascript coding from 1995-2015 ( use in old browsers)

Let and const were added in 2015.

Generally use const to assign variables
 IF the vaule of the variable is going to change, use let.
 
## Javascript identifiers

- All variables need a unique name tied to them.

Rules for those unique names:

-Has to start with a letter. ($ is allowed for a begining letter)

-Names are case sensitive

In javascript "=" does not mean equal to, it means assigned to. (== means equal to)

To assing a value to a varaible, use =
