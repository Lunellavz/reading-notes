**TEXT EDITORS**

Why the correct text editor depends on the person

From what I understand, there are multiple text editors that all have somewhat of the same baseline of things but differ in their own ways.
The top things to look for in a text editor are bulleted below:
* Code completion
* Syntax highlighting
* Themes

**But what do these mean?**

Well for starters, *code completion* is like a shortcut for when you are coding and if the text editor can bring up suggested codes.
Like when you type in google how to do whatever, you will get lots of suggestions and pop ups, but what matters are how accurate and close to the ones you were wanting to use.
Essentially, it should help you code faster!
  
Next up is *syntax highlighting*. I think syntax highlighting is my fvaorite becasue it makes your code stand out with different colored text.
  In other words it makes your code look pretty and nice to look at.
  
 Lastly, *themes*. sparkling up your websites or your phone background is fun and we do that with themes. In text editor, themes are your background for yours code.
  You want good themes that don't strain your eyes. Have you ever started at bright yellow text with a red background?
  I highly DON'T suggest doing that but you get the picture.
   
  Picking the correct text editor depends on these top 3 items I talked about. It will make coding either fun and easier for you or pretty and more engaging.
