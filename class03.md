# What is version control?

-Version control keeps a record of any modifications to files

-Local version control stores changed files

# What is Git?

-Git stores data of all saved changes you made ( commit )

-This is a way to keep track of your files and also easily track where something went wrong. Everything recorded.

-Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.

Committed

Data is securely stored in a local database

Modified

File has been changed but not committed to the database

Staged

Flagged a fileâ€™s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot.
