# What is a wireframe?

-A wireframe is the blueprint of your website. The very basic outline of the site.
-You can make a wireframe with online tools or with a simple pencil and paper.

It is recommended for first timers to use pencil and paper

Building a wireframe you need information about who your audiance is and what the owner would like the website to look like.

This is not where you get lost in decorations, as this is only the bare basics of your website.
